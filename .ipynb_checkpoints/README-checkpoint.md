# I have no idea what I'm doing

Now that that's out of the way,  

This project is just a mix of me learning the more oop aspects of python, testing some  
simulation and decision theory of my own programming, and seeing if I can maybe write  
some of my own machine learning programs.

If you somehow stumble upon this and no what you're doing, feel free to give me  
criticism. I really don't know what I'm doing.
